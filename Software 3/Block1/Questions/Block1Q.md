# SOF3/Block 1
# Problems

Problems in this set have been inspired by several sources, as well
from our own experience.  Two important sources are SOF1 and seminal
texts by [Henderson] [1] and by [Bird and Wadler][2].

These exercises are to ensure that you are:
* able to run Haskell
* can exploit the facilities of `GHCI`, the Haskell repl
  (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop);[Hoogλe][4] may also be helpful.
* can create simple definition files, and load them into the repl, and
* most importantly, become familiar with evalauable expressions using
  the definitions in the `Prelude`.

## Study

You should read [Hutton][3] Chapters 1–⁠4, 6, 7; ensure that you do all
the exercises.

You should study the two lectures "WhyFP" and "NewTypes".

## Q1: Evaluating simple expressions

Start up `ghci`.  (How you do this will depend on your chosen
operating system and access method.  One of us prefers to run `ghci`
through `emacs` on *nix-based OSs, such as MacOS and Linux.  Another
route is to give the command `ghci` to a shell running in a terminal.)

For each of the following expressions
* describe the expression in words,
* give its value,
* try it in the repl, and
* explain any differences to yourself.

1. `3 + 8`
2. `3^2`
3. `2^3^4 == (2^3)^4`
4. `2^3^4 == 2^(3^4)`
5. `0==1 || 0/=1`
6. `'h' : "ello"`
7. `7 : [6, 5, 4]`
8. `if 0==1 then "Alice" else "Bob"`
9. `let sqr = \ n -> n^2 in sqr 3 + sqr 4`
10. `let cube n = n^3 in cube 2 + cube 3`

## Q2: Determining types

The repl will also tell you the type of an expression.  The command
has the form: `:type <expression>` ("`type`" can be abbreviated to
`"t`, so the command becomes `:t <expression>`).

Commands to the repl take the general form `:<name> <parameters>`;
`<name>` can be abbreviated to the shortest string that is different
from any lexicographically earlier command.  The full list is
available through `:help`.  The command `quit` will terminate the
repl.

For each of the expressions above:
* decide what type it has,
* try it in the repl, and
* explain any difference to yourself.

## Q3: Detecting errors

A useful question to ask about any language is not what it allows, but
what **errors** it forbids.  There are various classes of error,
including:
* Syntactic (parse) errors
* Static semantic errors (includes typin errors — as in the type of
  the value, not keybaord skills!)
* Dynamic semantic errors
All except dynamic semantic errors are detectable by automated
analysis. (One of these is arguably not an error: which? why might it
be controversial?)

Each of the following expressions contains at least one error.  For
each:
* determine what kind of error it is,
* check with the repl (if possible),
* consider possible fixes, and
* decide if the error would be detected in other languages you know.

1. `if 0 then 'a' else 'b'`
2. `if 'a' == 'b' then 5`
3. `if 'a' = 'b' then 5 else 4`
4. `if 0 == 0 then 5 else 'b'`
5. `['0', 5, 9]`
6. `('a', 42`
7. `let sumSq m n = m^2 - n^2 in sumSq 3 4`
8. `let f (x:xs) = 42 in f []`
9. `let f n = if n == 0 then 0 else f (n+1) in f 3`
10. `* 2 3`
11. `"3333" :: Int`

## Q4: Simple expressions that use values defined in `Prelude`

For each of the following names defined in the `Prelude` use
[Hoogλe][4] to find a description of their value.  Where names are
related, they are grouped.

1. `fst`, `snd`
2. `curry`, `uncurry`
3. `succ`, `pred`
4. `negate`, `abs`, `signum`
5. `quot`, `rem`, `div`, `mod`, `divMod`
6. `gcd`
7. `id`, `const`, `(.)`
8. `flip`, `($)`
9. `error`, `undefined`
10. `map`, `(++)`, `filter`
11. `head`, `tail`, `last`, `init`
12. `(!!)`, `null`
13. `length`, `reverse`
14. `foldr`, `foldr1`, `foldl`, `foldl1`
14. `scanl`, `iterate`, `repeat`, `replicate`, `cycle`
15. `take`, `drop`, `takeWhile`, `dropWhile`, `break`, `splitAt`
16. `zip`, `zipWith`, `unzip`
17. `lines`, `words`, `unlines`, `unwords`

These are only a small proportion of the useful functions defined in
`Prelude`.

For each of the following expressions:
* describe the expression in words,
* give its type and value,
* try it in the repl, and
* explain any differences to yourself.

1. `length (drop 3 "hello world!")`
2. `take (length "hello") "goodbye all!"`
3. `dropWhile (/=' ') "hello world!"`
4. `filter (/=' ') "hello world!"`
5. `foldr (+) 0 [3, 5, 7]`
6. `foldl (+) 0 [3, 5, 7]`
7. `(foldr (-) 0 [3, 5, 7], foldl (-) 0 [3, 5, 7])`
8. `foldr (*) 1 [3, 5, 7]`
9. `zip [0..] ['A'..'Z']`
10. `takeWhile ((<9).fst) $ zip [0..] ['A'..'Z']`
11. `zip [0..] (take 9 ['A'..'Z'])`
12. `if 0==0 then "OK" else undefined`
13. `if 0==1 then "OK" else undefined`

## Q5: Simple functions

In this section you are asked to devlop some simple functions.  The
type of each is given, and a prototype implementation.  Holes in the
definition are marked by the special value `undefined`.  These will
compile, but any attempt to execute `undefined` results in termination
of the execution.

Each function is described in words and test examples given

### Q5.1

Construct a string containing `n` so that `greet "Bob" == "hello Bob!"`

The operator `(++)` joins lists together, strings are lists of characters
```haskell

greet :: String -> String
greet name = undefined

greetTest :: Bool
greetTest
  = greet "Kofi" == "Hello Kofi!"
    && greet "Jeremy" == "Hello Jeremy!"
    && greet "" == "Hello !"

```
### Q5.2

Calculate the cost of a number of cakes (See SOF1)
```haskell
cakeBill 2 3 == "The cost of 2 cakes at 3p each is 6p."
```
`show` converts values that have a string representation to a string
Example: show 42 == "42"
```haskell

cakeBill :: Int -> Int -> String
cakeBill quantity price = undefined

cakeBillTest :: Bool
cakeBillTest =
  cakeBill 0 3 == "The cost of 0 cakes at 3p each is 0p."
  && cakeBill 1 3 == "The cost of 1 cakes at 3p each is 3p."
  && cakeBill 2 3 == "The cost of 2 cakes at 3p each is 6p."

```
The function `cakeBill` does not get the case of 1 cake quite right.
Give a function `cakeBill'` that uses correct English grammar.
```haskell

cakeBill' :: Int -> Int -> String
cakeBill' quantity price = undefined

cakeBill'Test :: Bool
cakeBill'Test =
  cakeBill' 0 3 == "The cost of 0 cakes at 3p each is 0p."
  && cakeBill' 1 3 == "The cost of 1 cake at 3p each is 3p."
  && cakeBill' 2 3 == "The cost of 2 cakes at 3p each is 6p."

```
### Q5.3

See SOF1, Week 2, Exercise 3

A fruit company sells bananas for £3.00 a kilogram plus £4.99 per
order for postage and packaging. If an order, including postage and
packing, is over £50.00, the P&P is reduced by £1.50. Write a function
that will take the number of kilo of bananas as a user input and print
the cost of that order.

Extra to SOF1, Week 2, Exercise 3, the function should raise an error
if less than 2kg of bananas is ordered.
Assume that orders must be whole numbers of kilos, and cost is
expressed in in pennies.
```haskell

bananas :: Int -> Int
bananas order | order < min_order = undefined
              | undefined         = undefined
              | otherwise         = undefined

bananasTest :: Bool
bananasTest =
  bananas 2 == 1099
  && bananas 20 == 6349

```
### Q5.4

Showing the cost of an order in pennies is not pretty.  Write a
function to pretty print a number of pennies as pounds and pence.
Function `divMod` from `Prelude` may be useful.

Recall that a pattern can be used to get the parts of a pair.
For example:
```haskell
(x, y) = (2+1, 4*2)
```
defines`x` to be `3` and `y` to be `8`.

**NOTES**
* From now on, we only provide the minimal skeleton to allow the file
to pass the syntax and typing checks.  You will need to decide on
numbers and names of parameters, whether guards are needed, and so on.
* From now on you will need to construct your own tests.

```haskell

pennies2pounds :: Int -> String
pennies2pounds = undefined

```
### Q5.5

The implication operator on Booleans is not defined in `Prelude`.

Define it using other operators defined in `Prelude`.  Can you solve
the problem without explicit parameters?
```haskell
implies :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool -- explicit parameters
implies = undefined
implies_ :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool -- implicit parameters
implies_ = undefined

```
It is easy to define Boolean operators using truth tables.
For example we could define `(&&)` by:
```haskell
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True  && True  = True
True  && False = False
False && True  = False
False && False = False
```

An alternative is to use the "don't care" pattern, `_`, and take
advantage of the fact that patterns are matched in order:

```haskell
True && True = True
_    && _    = False
```

Define the implication operator twice more, once using a full truth
table and once using "don't care" patterns.
```haskell

implies', implies'' :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
implies' a b = undefined -- full table

implies''a b  = undefined -- using "don't care" patterns

```
### Q5.6

There is a well-known puzzle about a farmer taking a dog, a chicken
and a bag of grain across a river on a boat that will only take the
farmer and two of the items.  If the dog is left alone with the
chicken, it will eat the chicken, and similarly if the chicken is left
alone with the grain. (Other variants of the items exist, such as
wolf, goat and cabbage.)

We can model the goods by a new type, `Item` that has equality &
inequality defined on it, and can be converted to a string for
printing:
```haskell

data Item = Dog | Chicken | Grain deriving (Eq, Show)

```
Create a function `eats` that returns the list of `Item`s eaten by the
input item.
```haskell

eats :: Item -> [Item]
eats = undefined

```
Create a function `danger` that, given two `Item`s, reports if either
will eat the other.  You should use the function `eats` you have just
defined.  You may find the `Prelude` function `elem` useful.
```haskell

danger :: Item -> Item -> Bool
danger = undefined

```
## Q6: Recursive functions

### Q6.1

Write an explicitely recursive function, `incList` that returns a
result where each element is one more than the corrsponding input.
For example,
```haskell
incList [42, 7, 16] == [43, 8, 17]
```
Do this _without_ using any functions from `Prelude`.
```haskell

incList :: [Int] -> [Int]
incList [] = undefined
incList (n:ns) = undefined

```
Haskell has lots of functions in its libraries that capture particular
patterns of recursion.  The pattern in `incList` is _mapping_, found
in `Prelude`:
```haskell
map f [a, b, c] == [f a, f b, f c]
```
Define `incList'` using `map`.
```haskell
incList' :: [Int] -> [Int]
incList' = undefined

```
### Q6.2

The testing functions above are not very convenient, as they report
`False` if _any_ conjunct evaluates to `False`: it will not tell us
which conjuncts evaluated to `False`.  We can do better by using `map`
to apply a testing function to a range of inputs.

As an example, rewrite `greetTest` as `greetTest'`.

**Hint** map a function over a list of pairs, where each element has
the form `(input, expectedOutput)`.  The function can conveniently be
defined in a `where` clause.
```haskell
greetTest' = undefined

```
### Q6.3

Suppose that you are given a list that is known to contain a
particular element, but not its index.  Create a function `pos` to
return the index; if there is more than one, the smallest index should
be returned.  Indices start from `0`.  For example,
```haskell
pos 'h' "hello world" == 0
pos 'e' "hello world" == 1
pos 'l' "hello world" == 2
```
You may assume that the type in the list has _type class_ `Eq`.  That
is similar to saying that the type in the list implements the `Eq`
interface in an object oriented language.  It is indicated by the
prefix `Eq a =>` in the type, which we can read "Assuming `a` has type
class `Eq`...".

**Hint** define, and then use, a recursive, subsidiary function that
has type `Int -> [a] -> Int`; but note that if you use a `where`
clause to define the subsidiary function you will not be able to enter
the type in your file.
```haskell

pos :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Int
pos = undefined

```
### Q6.4

Define a function that inserts its value in the correct place in an
ordered list.  You may assume that the standard equality (`(==)`,
`(/=)`) and ordering operators (`(<)`, `(<=)`, `(>)`, `(>=)`) are
defined for the type of elements under consideration.
```haskell
insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert = undefined
```
Another important pattern of recursion is right-folding.

Recall that a list such as `[5, 7, 6, 2]` is actually syntactic sugar
for `5:(7:(6:(2:[])))`.  A right fold replaces the list-constructor,
"cons", `(:)` by an operator and the empty list, `[]`, by a constant.

For example, the right fold with `(+)` and `0` computes the sum of the list:
`5+(7+(6+(2+0)))`; the right fold with `(*)` and `1` computes the product:
`5*(7*(6*(2*1)))`.

It is called a right-fold because the expression associates to the
right.  The function is called `foldr`, and can be defined:
```haskell
foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr op unit []     = []
foldr op unit (x:xs) = x `op` (foldr op unit xs)
```
(The definition in `Prelude` is an optimised version.)

### Q6.5

Note that the operator need not be homogenous (`a -> a -> a`) but can
be more general (`a -> b -> b`).  Take advantage of this fact to
define insertion sort using `foldr` [hint: consider `insert` above].
For example:
```haskell
isort [9,8,7,6] == [6,7,8,9]
isort "hello" == "ehllo"
isort [True, False, True] == [False, True, True]
```
```haskell
isort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
isort = foldr undefined undefined

```
### Q6.6

It is possible to define insertion using a right fold, so that `isort`
is a nested pair of right folds.  Redefine insertion as a right fold.
```haskell
insert' :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert' x = foldr insx undefined
  where
    insx = undefined

```
### Q6.7

What does the following function, `mystery`, do?  (Think about it
before you try executing it.)
```haskell
mystery :: [a] -> [a]
mystery = foldr (:) []

```
### Q6.8

The map pattern is a special case of a right fold.  Define `mapAsRF`
to behave like `map`, using `foldr`.
```haskell

mapAsRF :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
mapAsRF f = undefined

```
### Q6.9

Sometimes a right fold is less efficient than a left fold.  The left
fold of `(+)` and `0` over `[5, 7, 6, 2]` is `(((0+5)+7)+6)+2`.  When
a homogenous (that is, has type `a -> a -> a`) operator is
_associative_, such as `(+)`, `(*)`, and `(++)`, the left and right
folds are equal.  When the operator is not associative, such as `(-)`,
the two folds may give different answers.  When the operator is not
homogenous (that is, it has type `a -> b -> b` for _different_ `a` and
`b`), the left fold of `flip f` may be different to the right fold of
`f`.

Evaluate `foldr (+) 0 [5, 7, 6, 2]` and `foldl (+) 0 [5, 7, 6, 2]` by
hand.  Be careful to preserve the bracketing of expressions. [You will
need to look up the definition of `foldl`; when evaluating `foldl`
always evaluate any additions that occur as soon as a possible (this
is actually `foldl'` rather than `foldl`, which does not matter for
this exercise).]
```haskell



```
A left fold can be much less efficient than a right fold.  When
evaluated on an infinite list it never gives any result, whereas a
right fold can, in some circumstances, produce partial results.

### Q6.10

Express reverse of a list twice, once as a right fold and once as a
left fold.
```haskell
revRF, revLF :: [a] -> [a]
revRF = foldr undefined undefined
revLF = foldl undefined undefined

```
### Q6.11
Express `length` of a list as both a right and a left fold.
```haskell
lenRF, lenLF :: [a] -> Int
lenRF = foldr undefined undefined
lenLF = foldl undefined undefined

```
### Q6.12

(See SOF1, Week 7.)

We can define a new type to represent vectors of Integers:
```haskell

type Vector = [Int]

```
Define scalar multiplication of vectors.  We will use the infix symbol
`(/*/)` to represent this operator.

```haskell
x /*/ [a, b, c] == [x * a, x * b, x * c]
```
```haskell

(/*/) :: Int -> Vector -> Vector
(/*/) = undefined

```
We can also define addition of vectors.  We will use the symbol `(/+/)`.
```haskell
[a, b, c] /+/ [d, e, f] == [a+d, b+e, c+f]
```

The problem here is that we have two lists, so `map` only does the job
if we convert the pair of lists into a list of pairs.  This is best
done with the `Prelude` function
`zipWith::(a->b->c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]`
that generalises `map` to pairs of lists.
```haskell
zipWith op [a, b, c] [d, e, f, g] == [a `op` d, b `op` e, c `op` f]
```
(Note that the output is the length of the shortest input.)
```haskell
(/+/) :: Vector -> Vector -> Vector
sumV = undefined

```
In SOF1/Practical 6A/Exercise 6 you are asked to implement equality on
vectors.

You do not need to implement equality, or inequality, on the Haskell
type `Vector`: it is predfined in `Prelude` for all list types whose
contents have equality defined, and any renamings, such as `Vector`.
```haskell


```
### Q6.13

Define your own version of `zipWith` using explicit recursion.
```haskell
zipWith' :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
zipWith' = undefined

```
### Q6.14

See SOF1/Practical 7/Exercise 4

Implement a function `merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -[a]`, that
expectes two _ordered_ lists of any type that can be compared, and
merges the two lists into an ordered list.
```haskell
merge :: Ord a => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
merge = undefined

```
Define a test `isOrdered :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool` that returns `True`
exactly when the parameter is ordered.

**Hint** Use zipWith on the parameter and its tail to get a `[Bool]`.
The list can then be combined with the `Prelude` function
`and::[Bool] -> Bool]`, defined by:
```haskell
and = foldr (&&) True
```
```haskell
isOrdered :: Ord a => [a] -> Bool
isOrdered = undefined
```
### Q6.15

See SOF1/Practical 7/Exercise 5

Write a function `something_ish :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool` and
hence a function `elfish`.

**Hint** Use the predefined right-fold/map combinators
`all :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> Bool)` and
`elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool` 
```haskell
something_ish :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> Bool
elfish :: String -> Bool
something_ish = undefined
elfish = undefined

```
